## Who am I?
### Software Engineer
I studied software engineering since 2010 and have been working in the field since 2012 (student job). My first software engineering job on the SAP tech stack writing ABAP. I also got to touch a bit of web and javascript. After 3 years I moved to another department doing JVM with Java and some Groovy, then I moved again to .NET and Angular on Azure. Basically I went where opportunity took me, the technology was just a means to an end, I see technology as tool or means to an end, the point is to use technology to reach your/the company goal. It was great to see how different teams work and develop software. The culture in every team I worked in is very different based on the technology stack. If I had to pick favourites it's definitely the culture in the .NET team, the java people I met were ridiculously religious against everything Microsoft. 
### Immigrant & Dual citizen
I was born in Romania but moved to Denmark right after high school for university. I ended settling in Denmark but it came at a great cost. I had to leave my parents and all my childhood friends behind. I jumped head first in a foreign land where there were no friends or family to support me. It was tough in the start but somehow I've managed to find a place for myself in this country. I met lots of amazing people and made some great friends along the way. After 11 years in Denmark, some bureaucracy and a culture test I can proudly call myself Danish and I got to keep the Romanian title too.    
### Hobby PC Gamer
Since the pandemic started I picked up World of Warcraft again but I try to limit the amount of time I spend on it so I can try other games. More recently I've been enjoying Velheim and Risk of Rain 2 with my very good mates.
