      <description>Background Last week I was working on some end to end tests where we use an observable. This observable is using a TaskCompletionSource that we use to &amp;ldquo;close the subscription&amp;rdquo;. When we got the data we expected from the observable we would call SetResult on our TaskCompletionSource.
To prevent the observable from running forever, we used a CancelationTokenSource with a timeout. When the timeout occurs we made it call SetResult on our TaskCompletionSource.</description>
