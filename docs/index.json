AWS with dotnet using C# This blog is the about the life of a full stack software engineer experienced with dotnet and Angular, currently working with dotnet on AWS infrastructure at one of the largest toy companies in the world.\n   Who am I? Software Engineer I studied software engineering since 2010 and have been working in the field since 2012 (student job). My first software engineering job on the SAP tech stack writing ABAP. I also got to touch a bit of web and javascript. After 3 years I moved to another department doing JVM with Java and some Groovy, then I moved again to .NET and Angular on Azure. Basically I went where opportunity took me, the technology was just a means to an end, I see technology as tool or means to an end, the point is to use technology to reach your/the company goal. It was great to see how different teams work and develop software. The culture in every team I worked in is very different based on the technology stack. If I had to pick favourites it\u0026rsquo;s definitely the culture in the .NET team, the java people I met were ridiculously religious against everything Microsoft.\nImmigrant \u0026amp; Dual citizen I was born in Romania but moved to Denmark right after high school for university. I ended settling in Denmark but it came at a great cost. I had to leave my parents and all my childhood friends behind. I jumped head first in a foreign land where there were no friends or family to support me. It was tough in the start but somehow I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to find a place for myself in this country. I met lots of amazing people and made some great friends along the way. After 11 years in Denmark, some bureaucracy and a culture test I can proudly call myself Danish and I got to keep the Romanian title too.\nHobby PC Gamer Since the pandemic started I picked up World of Warcraft again but I try to limit the amount of time I spend on it so I can try other games. More recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying Velheim and Risk of Rain 2 with my very good mates.\n Denmark in March   ",
