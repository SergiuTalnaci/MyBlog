    "body": "STREAM Camera in PowerPoint Necessary software to install  OBS Obs websocket server Powerpoint OBS scene switcher  OBS Install OBS from here: Obs download link\nOBS websocket server For websocket server, you can find the file by scrolling all the way down, Install OBS websocket server plugin from here: Obs websocket server github releases. Download the installer that matches your OS, or unzip the contents of the ZIP file into the folder where you installed OBS (C:\\OBSINSTALLPATH\\obsstudio). I recommend closing OBS before installing or unzipping the websocket server. Once installed open OBS again, in the top menu click on Tools -\u0026gt; WebSockets Server Settings. It should look like this:\nEnable authentication and set a password you can remember and type later. We will need to input the password we set here in the Powerpoint OBS scene Switcher.\nWe need the webserver extension to change the OBS scenes when we change our powerpoint slides.\nPowerpoint OBS Scene Switcher Clone or download the scene switcher code. I have included a built version of the program you can just run in the Compiled Executable folder. Otherwise you will need visual studio 2019 or newer to build and run the code.\nSetup Video resolution In the lower right side of the screen there is a Settings button, click it and it should show an option popup. Click on the Video tab in the popup window. Set Base (canvas) Resolution and Output (Scaled) Resolution to 1920x1080.\nI picked 1920x1080 as a resolution because it is the largest audience who has this screen format. It also scales well to 720p or 1440p screens. For all the other high end devices, they probably run on a higher resolution that can comfortably view the stream at 1080p.\nObs Scenes After you install OBS, by default it will have 3 scenes, I chose the first \u0026ldquo;Scene\u0026rdquo; as the \u0026ldquo;base scene\u0026rdquo; where I\u0026rsquo;ve added my microphone and camera as sources. We will use this scene with all of our slides, as it is simply the camera and microphone.\nAs you can see in the image below, I\u0026rsquo;ve added Scene and Display Capture, as input sources. We will need to do this for every slide where our green screen changes. Let\u0026rsquo;s being by creating a Scene and name it Slide 0. Under sources click the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; button and select Scene as a source. Now we need to set a chroma filter for our display capture, this will allow the layer beneath the top layer, in this case our \u0026ldquo;Scene\u0026rdquo; layer will be shown in places where we have the right color green.\n Right click the \u0026ldquo;Display Capture\u0026rdquo; source. Click on Filters. In the popup settings window select the Chroma key effect filter, if it\u0026rsquo;s missing add it from the \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo; sign under Effect Filters. Set the Key Color Type to Green and use a Similarity value of 360.  Now that we have our Scenes settings in order, make sure that both the scene and the Display Capture are full screen on the preview canvas. In my case I see the desktop of the display capture surrounded by a red square which is the base \u0026ldquo;Scene\u0026rdquo; that contains the camera and microphone input.\nWith these 2 layers, in order OBS will now make the color green of our display capture \u0026ldquo;transparent\u0026rdquo; so our 2nd layer can be seen through the green.\nPowerpoint Slides In our PowerPoint slides we simply put green wherever we want to appear, for example this is my first slide. Note that I put a slide from the left side animation on my name card to make it look more modern and integrated.\nAnother important sidenote, in PowerPoint remember to add Slide 0 in the presenter comments. The image below is how it looks like on OBS in my \u0026ldquo;Slide 0\u0026rdquo; scene. As you can see the non green part of the screen is on top of my camera input, or in other words, everything that is screen becomes transparent on the \u0026ldquo;Display Capture\u0026rdquo; source so we can see the scene \u0026ldquo;Scene\u0026rdquo; which is the Camera and Sound Capture.\nCenter yourself to the side of the screen In this slide I want to place myself to the left side of the screen. To do this I made the powerpoint slide with a large green block on the left side. I\u0026rsquo;ve also added \u0026ldquo;Slide 2\u0026rdquo; in the presenter comments of this Power point slide. Now we need to setup Slide 2 scene in OBS.\nAs usual we use the Display Capture Source and Scene source, but note that I dragged the scene with my mouse to the left. You can see the \u0026ldquo;Scene source\u0026rdquo; is moved to the left, so much left that the left part of it is out of the canvas and won\u0026rsquo;t be seen or rendered. However this allows us to be in the center of “Scene” to while being on the left side of the Powerpoint screen.\nOBS Powerpoint scene switcher Present in Microsoft Teams  Virtual camera Share screen preview Now for the fun part, presentations  Virtual camera Screen share ",

    "body": "Whom is this blog for? AWS with dotnet using C# This blog is the about the life of a full stack software engineer experienced with dotnet and Angular, currently working with dotnet on AWS infrastructure at one of the largest toy companies in the world.\n   Who am I? Software Engineer I studied software engineering since 2010 and have been working in the field since 2012 (student job). My first software engineering job on the SAP tech stack writing ABAP. I also got to touch a bit of web and javascript. After 3 years I moved to another department doing JVM with Java and some Groovy, then I moved again to .NET and Angular on Azure. Basically I went where opportunity took me, the technology was just a means to an end, I see technology as tool or means to an end, the point is to use technology to reach your/the company goal. It was great to see how different teams work and develop software. The culture in every team I worked in is very different based on the technology stack. If I had to pick favourites it\u0026rsquo;s definitely the culture in the .NET team, the java people I met were ridiculously religious against everything Microsoft.\nImmigrant \u0026amp; Dual citizen I was born in Romania but moved to Denmark right after high school for university. I ended settling in Denmark but it came at a great cost. I had to leave my parents and all my childhood friends behind. I jumped head first in a foreign land where there were no friends or family to support me. It was tough in the start but somehow I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to find a place for myself in this country. I met lots of amazing people and made some great friends along the way. After 11 years in Denmark, some bureaucracy and a culture test I can proudly call myself Danish and I got to keep the Romanian title too.\nHobby PC Gamer Since the pandemic started I picked up World of Warcraft again but I try to limit the amount of time I spend on it so I can try other games. More recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying Velheim and Risk of Rain 2 with my very good mates.\n Denmark in March   ",
